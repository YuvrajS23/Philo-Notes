By ***Yuvraj Singh (210050172)***

## 1. What is Philosophy

 - When a philosopher gets it wrong, no one dies.
 - Philosophers have inspired the world, their ideas live long after they have physically disappeared from the planet.
 - *A philosopher does not try to comfort the afflicted, but he/she will definitely afflict the comforted.*
 - **Ph.D.** = doctor of PHILOSOPHY

> Etymologically - **φίλος** (phílos: friend, or lover) and **σοφία** (sophía: wisdom).                     - Coined by *Pythagoras*

### 1.1 Indian Philosophy

#### 1.1.1. Three terms for philosophy in India -
##### 1. **Anviksiki** {*आन्वीक्षिकी*} - 
- **Kautilya** in his *Arthashastram* talks about the 4 types of knowledge (vidyas) that are 
  - आन्वीक्षिकी (AnvIkshikI) -> critical examining with the means of proper argument
  - वेदत्रयी (vedatrayI) -> the understanding of vedas to understand Dharma
  -  वार्ता (vArtA) -> knowledge of trade and economics and 
  -  दंडनीति (Daṇḍanīti)-> political science and law
- Ānvīkṣikī is the **systematic / intellectual inquiry** without alluding any scriptural and spiritual leanings as it is the labour of human intellect and reasoning or logic.
- Ānvīkṣikī is ever accepted to be the lamp of all branches of learning, the means for all kinds of activities and the basis of all virtues.

>  प्रदीपः सर्वविद्यानाम् उपायः सर्वकर्मणाम् ।
    आश्रयः सर्वधर्माणां शश्वद् आन्वीक्ष्हिकी मता ||

##### 2. Darshan {*दर्श् – to see*} -
- **Vision of things** or the **insight** into the nature of reality.

##### 3. Mata {*मत*} -
- Mata means **opinion**, **thought**, and therefore a *doctrine* or a *theory*.
- Also used for the context of *religion* in India.

#### 1.1.2. Two traditions/divisions of Indian Philosophy -
##### 1. Orthodox System {*Astika Darshana*} : 
- Accept the *authority of the Vedas*.
- 6 Orthodox Schools
  1. the Sankhya
  2. the Vaiseshika
  3. the Nyaya
  4. the Yoga
  5. the Mimamsa and 
  6. the Vedanta.

##### 2. Heterodox System {*Nastika Darshana*} :
- Reject the *authority of the Vedas*.
- 3 Heterodox Schools
  1. the Charvaka
  2. the Buddhism and
  3. the Jainism

### 1.2 Value of Philosophy
 - *Philosophy is to be studied, not for the sake of any utility; or not for the sake of any definite answers to its questions, since no definite answer can, as a rule, be known to be true, but **for the sake of questions themselves.** Because these questions enlarge our conception of what is possible, enrich our intellectual imagination and diminish the dogmatic and fundamentalist approach which closes the mind against speculation and open mindedness.*
 - **Are you a Philosopher?** Then Question and Examine Everything

> 1. **An unexamined life is not worth living**.  - *Socrates*.
> 2. Wisdom can never be handed down unlike beliefs and knowledge.

## 2. Branches of Philosophy

- Two kinds of Knowledge -
  1. **Scientific Knowledge -**
   - Seek to analyze all laws, discipline by discipline.
   - Disciplines differ in the specificity of their POV.
  2. **Philosophical Knowledge -**
   - Interrogation made to understand one’s own **life** and to situate oneself in existence.
   - Man is distinguished from animals by his/her use of rational mind.

- The following are the branches of philosophy -
### a. Metaphysics - (Beyond / After Physics)
- Aristotle wrote *TA META TA PHYSIKA* after *TA PHYSIKA*.
- It answers the question **What is?**. It encompasses everything that exists, as well as the nature of existence itself.
- It is a fundamental view of world around us.
### b. Epistemology - (Theory of Knowledge)
- Study of method of *acquiring knowledge*.
- **Importance -**  It is the explanation of *how we think*. It is required in order to be able to *determine the true from the false*, by determining a proper method of evaluation.
- **Key Elements -** 
  -  Our senses are valid, and the only way to gain information about the world.
  -  **Reason** is our method of gaining knowledge, and acquiring understanding.
  -  **Logic** is our method of maintaining consistency within our set of knowledge.
  -  **Concepts** are abstracts of specific details of reality, or of other abstractions.
### c. Ethics - (*ethikos-ethos* meaning custom  / character)
- Ethics is the science of morals or that branch of philosophy which is concerned with human character and conduct.
- Deals with what is the proper course of action for man. It answers the question, *What do I do?* It is the **study of right and wrong** in human endeavors.
- Ethical norms can exist only where *freedom* and *accountability* are found.
> Many things come the way of human beings neither in the course of nature, nor after learning, but after habituation - *Eudemian Ethics by Aristotle*

---

## 3. Three Laws of Thought -

### a. The Law of Identity{*p=p*}
- Every statement of the form *p => p* is true.
- In order for a person to be morally *praiseworthy* or *blameworthy* for an action, he or she must *be the same person* before the act as during the act and after the act.
### b. The Law of Contradiction / Non-Contradiction{*p^~p = False*}
- Every statement of the form *p . − p (= p and not p)* is *false*;
- *One cannot say of something that it is and that it is not in the same respect and at the same time* - Aristotle
### c. The Law of Excluded Middle{*p or ~p = True*}
- The principle of excluded middle asserts that any statement is either true or false.
- Every statement of the form *p v − p* is *true*.
- *tertium non datur* - A third is not given
> These three principles are true without any chance for doubt.

## 4. Three Key Instances of Indian Philosophy

##### 1. Many and One - Upanishads
##### 2. Middleway - Buddhist Thought
##### 3. Materialism - Charvaka

### 4.1 Upanishads: Many & the One

#### 4.1.1 The Vedas and the Upanishads: Philosophical Ideas
  - Different facets of Vedic thought - the *Mantras*, the *Brahmanas*, the *Aranyakas* & then the *Upanishads*.
  - Upanishad emerged with more rational and ethical approach with a disregard for the overemphasis on ritualism.
  - *Brahmanas to Aranyakas* - not absolute distinction.
  - *Aranyakas to Upanishads* - not absolute distinction.
  - *Brahmanas to Upanishads* - clear transition.
  - *Upanishads* took a more philosophical, ethical and logical turn whereas *Brahmanas* were mostly sacrificial and ritualistic in nature.
  - Each Upanishad belongs to one of the Vedas except *Isha Upanishad* which forms a direct part of the *Shukla Yajurveda Samhita*.
#### 4.1.2 Upanishads
  - Referred to reality as **the Atman** and **the Brahman**.
  - **Brahman** - *Supreme Spirit*, *Ever-Growing, Ever-Expanding* or ***the Absolute***.
  - **Atman** - *Spirit* or the *Self*.
#### 4.1.3 The Major/Principle Upanishads
  - According to *Muktikopanishad*, there are **108** Upanishads and among them following 10 are major ones -
> **Isha, Kena, Katha, Prashna, Mundaka, Mandukya, Taittiriya, Aitareya, Chandogya and Brihadaranyaka Upanishad**
#### 4.1.4 Many and the One: Vedic Religion to Upanishadic Philosophy
  -  The Vedic religion traverses from **Polytheism**(Many Gods and I follow many) => **Henotheism**(Many Gods but I follow one) =>  **Monotheism**(Only one god) => **to Monism**(belief in ultimate unity).
  -  *Rigveda* gradually traverses from Polytheism to Monism.
  -  There is One Reality, but the sages (wise) declare as many.
> **एकं सद् विप्रा बहुधा वदन्ति||**
#### The One - Monism in the Upanishads
- Upanishads call the one reality as *Brahman*
- It is **सत्यस्य सत्यम** (Truth of the Truth) in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.
- **एकमेव अद्वितीयम्** (One without any second) in Chandogya Upanishad.
- **सत्, चित् and आनन्द** meaning *being, conciousness & bliss* in Taittireya and Brihadarnyaka Upanishad.

> **Passage: Bihadarnyaka Upanishad Chapter 3, Section 9**
> - In this passage from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Vidagdha asks Yājñavalkya about the number and nature of gods. Yājñavalkya responds by stating that there are various levels of gods, ranging from three hundred and three to one. He explains that these numbers represent different manifestations of divine beings.
> - Yājñavalkya then identifies the thirty-three primary gods, which include the eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Ādityas, Indra, and Prajāpati. Each of these gods has a specific domain or function in the universe.
> - The text also explores the significance of different deities associated with various directions. For instance, the sun is associated with the east, Yama with the south, Varuna with the west, Soma with the north, and fire with the fixed direction above. These deities are linked to elements and concepts in the world.
> - Yājñavalkya emphasizes the importance of understanding the interconnectedness of these deities and their relationship to the heart, which is considered the center of the self. He stresses that all these deities and aspects of existence ultimately rest on the heart, symbolizing the unity of the divine and the individual.
> - The passage concludes with a challenge from Yājñavalkya, demanding knowledge of the transcendent, all-encompassing being that underlies everything. When Śākalya fails to provide this knowledge, he loses his head, symbolizing the consequences of ignorance.
> - In the end, Yājñavalkya demonstrates a deep understanding of the interconnectedness of the divine, the self, and the universe, emphasizing the importance of realizing the ultimate truth or Brahman.

## 4.2 The MiddleWay - Buddhist Thought

- The *Middle Way* {*मध्यम-प्रतिपदा*} in **Buddhism** avoids the extremes of self-gratification (*hedonism*) on one hand and self-mortification (*asceticism*) on the other.
- The Buddha understood and thought the two characteristics of the middle path -
  1. **Dependent Origination -** The Law of Dependent Origination explains the process of human activity.
  2. **Eightfold Path -** The Noble Eightfold Path shows the way of practice that enables one to uplift oneself.
### 4.2.1 The Middle Path of the Buddha'a Life
#### Life in a Palace -
  - He was brought up as a prince in a royal palace, fully unknown from any trace of *suffering*.
  - The Four Sights - {*Old age, Sickness, Death* and a *Religious Renouncer*} made him aware of suffering(1-3) and a possibility to get rid of it(4). So he left the palace to wander in the forest in search of truth. **घर की मुर्ग़ी दाल बराबर ||** 
#### Life in the Forest -
  -  In forest, he spent periods learning from two different teachers but was not satisfied with their teaching.
  -  He then met *5 ascetics*, who believed that practising austerities such as extreme fasting, bodily pain, etc would lead to rewards in a future life.
  -  After excelling at austerities, he realised their limitations and recognised that to make further progress he needed *the Middle Way*.
  -  He went on to find the balance between the two extremes that would liberate oneself.
### 4.2.2 The Middle Way in the History of Buddhist Ideas
  - The Buddha, in his first teaching advocated a middle way that avoided the two extremes of *self-indulgence* & *self-denial* as cited in *Dhamma-cakka-ppavattana Sutta* (*धम्मचक्कपवत्तन सुत्त*).
  - He presented the **8-Fold Path** as a path that follows the middle way.
  - In *Kaccayanagotta Sutta* (*काच्चायनगोत्त सुत्त*), he described middle way as free from the extremes of *eternalism* and *annhilationism*.
  - After Buddha's demise, Buddhist scholars formed different schools of thoughts based on their interpretations.
  - In 2^nd^ century AD, **Nagarjuna**, presented a very refined interpretation of middle-way and *Madhyamika* or middle-way school was formed.
### 4.2.3 The Middle Way from the Suttas
#### 4.2.3.1 The Middle Way and the Buddha's "Silence"
  -  The Buddha remained silent when he thought it would not be useful to answer metaphysical questions, and explained that metaphysical views were *unbeneficial, it does not belong to the fundamentals of the holy life.*
#### 4.2.3.2 Rely on One’s Experience rather than Religious Authority
  -  In the episode *Anguttara Nikaya* of *Kalama Sutta*, Buddha was asked for advise by villagers on which religious teacher to trust, to which he advised ***when you yourselves know*** that is one should consult our own experience rather than relying on religious authority.
#### 4.2.3.3 The Parable of the Boat
  -  The parable of the boat/raft in *Majjhima Nikaya of Alagaddupamasutta* illustrates that like the boat left on the bank of the river, the teachings should be contingent and adaptable, not held as absolute metaphysical truths.
### 4.2.4 The Philosophical Middle Way
  -  Psychologically, the middle way describes the middle ground between *attachment* and *aversion*.
  -  Philosophically, it is the middle position between *being* and *non-being*, between *form* and *emptiness*, between *free will* and *determinism*.
### 4.2.5 Conclusion
  - The Buddha described himself as a **vibhajyavādin** (*one who asserts propositions conditionally*) rather than an **ekāntavādin** (*one who maintains one absolute position*).
  - “*Be a lamp unto yourself*,” says the Buddha. Your questions light the way in the *Kalama Sutta*.
  - The Middle Way is intended both as an **ethical method** and as a primer for **correct reasoning**.
> - **सर्वं दुःखं दुःखं; सर्वं क्षणिकं क्षणिकम्; सर्वं अनात्मं अनात्मम्।**
> - Nature of reality is being marked by three factors: suffering(*dhukh*), impermanance(*anitya*) and the lack of abiding self(*anatman*).

## 4.3 INDIAN MATERIALISM, NATURALISM AND SCEPTICISM

- Major parts of Indian Philosophy has been *this wordily, naturalistic and rational* and the roots of **skepticism** in India go back a long way.
- *Indian philosophy can hardly be characterized as spiritual in character* - Daya Krishna.
- There are elements of *materialism, scepticism, positivism, atheism and hedonism* in Indian thought.
> - **Materialism -** Ultimate constituents of reality are material/physical bodies, elements/processes.
> - **Positivism -** Commitment to empirical methods & rejection of metaphysical tradition.
> - **Atheism -** Affirms the non-existence of God.
> - **Hedonism -** Pleasure is the highest good & one should seek pleasure and avoid pain.

### Skepticism -
- Etymologically - *SKEPSIS* > examination/enquiry/consideration.
- It is a critical attitude which systematically *questions the notion* that absolute knowledge and certainty are possible.
- Opposed to *Dogmatism* > which maintains certain set of +ve statements as authoritative and true.
- *Is there any diff. between knowing and dreaming* - Zhuang Zhou (Chuang Tzu).
- Skepticism => Assume nothing at all. i.e. *an object appears white or black, not that it is white or black.*

### 4.3.1 Charvaka/Lokayata(700 BC -)
- Etymologically - *लोकायत* = *लोकेषु आयतः* > Philosophy of the people.
- Also means philosophy of this-worldliness or materialism.
- It rejected all those views which are beyond the experience of human life here and now.

### 4.3.2 References of Charvaka
- The *Barhaspatya/Lokayata-Sutras* as identified by the RigVeda are no longer in existence but 54 sutras by *Brihaspati* were collected by *Dakshinaranjan Shastri*.
- *Tattvopaplavasingha(तत्त्वोपप्लवसिंह)* by *Jayarashi Bhatta* is considered a work of old charvaka by Sukhalaji Sanghavi but is considered extremely skeptic by others.
- Info. about Charvaka views may be gathered from criticism against it.
- Also, considerable material can be found in:
  - Chhandogya Upanishad
  - Mahabharata (Shantiparva & Shalyaparva), etc.

### 4.3.3 Main Tenets of Charvaka Philosophy

#### 1. Naturalism, No Causality(स्वभव)
  - A thing by its nature (svabhava) comes into existence at a particular time without any cause. > **‘effect’ does not depend on any cause**.
  - Causality is an imaginary relation between antecedents and consequents, which are perceived together on many occasions.
  - The sequence of two events perceived in the past on numerous occasions may fail in future under unforeseen circumstances.
#### 2. Perception: the only means of Knowledge, Denial of Inference(प्रत्यक्ष)
  - Perception gathered through 5 sense organs is either external or internal.
  - Internal perception depends on external perception. i.e *Manas* depends on external sense organs.
  - Charvakas advocate naive **realism** and **empricism**.
> - **Realism-** asserts that the objects of knowledge exist independently of the minds.
> - **Empiricism-** asserts that all knowledge is ultimately based on experience.

#### 3. Materialism
  - World is composed of 4 elements: *Earth, Water, Air & FIre* and the existence of 5th *Ether* is denied as it is not perceived.
  - Consciousness is produced by the material elements.

#### 4. No Soul/Atman
  - The soul/atman is only the body endued with consciousness.
  - Soul does not exist apart from the body.
#### 5. No Pre-existence and Future
  - No pre-existence of soul before birth and no future existence after death.
#### 6. No Heaven and Hell
  - Heavenly happiness is only an imagination.
  - There is no other hell than bodily pain.
#### 7. No God
#### 8. Death is Moksha
  - Meaning of Moksha/liberation is the end of suffering. With death all sufferings come to an end.
#### 9. Hedonism
  -  Charvakas reject *Dharma & Moksha* as *Purusharthas* and believes that *Kama*(Pleasure) is the supreme end & *Artha*(Wealth) is a means to it.
  -  *Eat, drink and make merry, for tomorrow you will die* #LiveInHappiness #BodilyPleasureIsCertain #HeavenIsUncertain
  - However, *Vastyayana*, the author of **Kama Sutra**, makes a distinction between *higher pleasure* and *lower pleasure*. He includes *Kama, Artha and Dharma* (Trivargika) also in the list of *purusharthas*.
  - 64 Fine Arts(*Kala*) which gives refines pleasure.

### 4.3.4 Critical Appreciation of the Charvaka Philosophy
- Common to *Egoistic Hedonism of Aristippus* > Emphasis on individual happiness and sensual pleasures.
- Much in common with *Epicureanism* > ‘Innate’ human attitude is the pursuit of pleasure as the only positive value.
#### Contribution of Charvaka -
  - Helped Indian Philosophy from becoming too dogmatic and religious.
  - Rationality took upper hand and superstitions and blind faith were challenged.
  - Provoked the keenest controversy and intellectual pursuit on Indian soil.

### 4.3.5 Other Sceptics of Indian Thought
- **Sanjaya(6th Century BC)** proposed 4 negative propositions in order to avoid errors in philosophical discourse.
  - A is not B
  - A is not ~B
  - A is not (B.~B)
  - A is not ~(B.~B)
- He never made any positive statement about anything. He differed from the Absolutism/dogmatism, and resorted to negative pronouncements without asserting an ultimate reality that transcends empirical description. 
- **Buddha** disregarded all speculations as he found them useless and irrelevant to solve the practical problem of human suffering.
- **Nagarjuna(150 AD)** was skeptical of all philosophical standpoints. He dismantled theoretical positions in a methodically logical manner wherever he found them.
- **Jayarasi Bhatta(800-840AD)** author of *Tattvopaplava-siṁha*, claimed that it is not possible to arrive at true knowledge with standard means recognized by the traditionally adopted model of cognitive procedures (pramāṇa) in Indian epistemology.
