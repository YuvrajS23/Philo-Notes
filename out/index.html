<li>When a philosopher gets it wrong, no one dies.</li>
<li>Philosophers have inspired the world, their ideas live long after they have physically disappeared from the planet.</li>
<li><em>A philosopher does not try to comfort the afflicted, but he/she will definitely afflict the comforted.</em></li>

<li><em>Philosophy is to be studied, not for the sake of any utility; or not for the sake of any definite answers to its questions, since no definite answer can, as a rule, be known to be true, but <strong>for the sake of questions themselves.</strong> Because these questions enlarge our conception of what is possible, enrich our intellectual imagination and diminish the dogmatic and fundamentalist approach which closes the mind against speculation and open mindedness.</em></li>

<p><strong>Passage: Bihadarnyaka Upanishad Chapter 3, Section 9</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In this passage from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Vidagdha asks Yājñavalkya about the number and nature of gods. Yājñavalkya responds by stating that there are various levels of gods, ranging from three hundred and three to one. He explains that these numbers represent different manifestations of divine beings.</li>
<li>Yājñavalkya then identifies the thirty-three primary gods, which include the eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Ādityas, Indra, and Prajāpati. Each of these gods has a specific domain or function in the universe.</li>
<li>The text also explores the significance of different deities associated with various directions. For instance, the sun is associated with the east, Yama with the south, Varuna with the west, Soma with the north, and fire with the fixed direction above. These deities are linked to elements and concepts in the world.</li>
<li>Yājñavalkya emphasizes the importance of understanding the interconnectedness of these deities and their relationship to the heart, which is considered the center of the self. He stresses that all these deities and aspects of existence ultimately rest on the heart, symbolizing the unity of the divine and the individual.</li>
<li>The passage concludes with a challenge from Yājñavalkya, demanding knowledge of the transcendent, all-encompassing being that underlies everything. When Śākalya fails to provide this knowledge, he loses his head, symbolizing the consequences of ignorance.</li>
<li>In the end, Yājñavalkya demonstrates a deep understanding of the interconnectedness of the divine, the self, and the universe, emphasizing the importance of realizing the ultimate truth or Brahman.</li>

<h2 id="42-the-middleway---buddhist-thought">4.2 The MiddleWay - Buddhist Thought</h2>

<li>The <em>Middle Way</em> {<em>मध्यम-प्रतिपदा</em>} in <strong>Buddhism</strong> avoids the extremes of self-gratification (<em>hedonism</em>) on one hand and self-mortification (<em>asceticism</em>) on the other.</li>
<li>The Buddha understood and thought the two characteristics of the middle path -
<ol>
<li><strong>Dependent Origination -</strong> The Law of Dependent Origination explains the process of human activity.</li>
<li><strong>Eightfold Path -</strong> The Noble Eightfold Path shows the way of practice that enables one to uplift oneself.</li>

<h4 id="life-in-a-palace--">Life in a Palace -</h4>
<ul>
<li>He was brought up as a prince in a royal palace, fully unknown from any trace of <em>suffering</em>.</li>
<li>The Four Sights - {<em>Old age, Sickness, Death</em> and a <em>Religious Renouncer</em>} made him aware of suffering(1-3) and a possibility to get rid of it(4). So he left the palace to wander in the forest in search of truth. <strong>घर की मुर्ग़ी दाल बराबर ||</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="life-in-the-forest--">Life in the Forest -</h4>
<ul>
<li>In forest, he spent periods learning from two different teachers but was not satisfied with their teaching.</li>
<li>He then met <em>5 ascetics</em>, who believed that practising austerities such as extreme fasting, bodily pain, etc would lead to rewards in a future life.</li>
<li>After excelling at austerities, he realised their limitations and recognised that to make further progress he needed <em>the Middle Way</em>.</li>
<li>He went on to find the balance between the two extremes that would liberate oneself.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="422-the-middle-way-in-the-history-of-buddhist-ideas">4.2.2 The Middle Way in the History of Buddhist Ideas</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Buddha, in his first teaching advocated a middle way that avoided the two extremes of <em>self-indulgence</em> &amp; <em>self-denial</em> as cited in <em>Dhamma-cakka-ppavattana Sutta</em> (<em>धम्मचक्कपवत्तन सुत्त</em>).</li>
<li>He presented the <strong>8-Fold Path</strong> as a path that follows the middle way.</li>
<li>In <em>Kaccayanagotta Sutta</em> (<em>काच्चायनगोत्त सुत्त</em>), he described middle way as free from the extremes of <em>eternalism</em> and <em>annhilationism</em>.</li>
<li>After Buddha's demise, Buddhist scholars formed different schools of thoughts based on their interpretations.</li>
<li>In 2^nd^ century AD, <strong>Nagarjuna</strong>, presented a very refined interpretation of middle-way and <em>Madhyamika</em> or middle-way school was formed.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The Buddha remained silent when he thought it would not be useful to answer metaphysical questions, and explained that metaphysical views were <em>unbeneficial, it does not belong to the fundamentals of the holy life.</em></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4232-rely-on-ones-experience-rather-than-religious-authority">4.2.3.2 Rely on One’s Experience rather than Religious Authority</h4>
<ul>
<li>In the episode <em>Anguttara Nikaya</em> of <em>Kalama Sutta</em>, Buddha was asked for advise by villagers on which religious teacher to trust, to which he advised <em><strong>when you yourselves know</strong></em> that is one should consult our own experience rather than relying on religious authority.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4233-the-parable-of-the-boat">4.2.3.3 The Parable of the Boat</h4>
<ul>
<li>The parable of the boat/raft in <em>Majjhima Nikaya of Alagaddupamasutta</em> illustrates that like the boat left on the bank of the river, the teachings should be contingent and adaptable, not held as absolute metaphysical truths.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="424-the-philosophical-middle-way">4.2.4 The Philosophical Middle Way</h3>
<ul>
<li>Psychologically, the middle way describes the middle ground between <em>attachment</em> and <em>aversion</em>.</li>
<li>Philosophically, it is the middle position between <em>being</em> and <em>non-being</em>, between <em>form</em> and <em>emptiness</em>, between <em>free will</em> and <em>determinism</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="425-conclusion">4.2.5 Conclusion</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Buddha described himself as a <strong>vibhajyavādin</strong> (<em>one who asserts propositions conditionally</em>) rather than an <strong>ekāntavādin</strong> (<em>one who maintains one absolute position</em>).</li>
<li>“<em>Be a lamp unto yourself</em>,” says the Buddha. Your questions light the way in the <em>Kalama Sutta</em>.</li>
<li>The Middle Way is intended both as an <strong>ethical method</strong> and as a primer for <strong>correct reasoning</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>सर्वं दुःखं दुःखं; सर्वं क्षणिकं क्षणिकम्; सर्वं अनात्मं अनात्मम्।</strong></li>
<li>Nature of reality is being marked by three factors: suffering(<em>dhukh</em>), impermanance(<em>anitya</em>) and the lack of abiding self(<em>anatman</em>).</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sanjaya(6th Century BC)</strong> proposed 4 negative propositions in order to avoid errors in philosophical discourse.
<ul>
<li>A is not B</li>
<li>A is not ~B</li>
<li>A is not (B.~B)</li>
<li>A is not ~(B.~B)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He never made any positive statement about anything. He differed from the Absolutism/dogmatism, and resorted to negative pronouncements without asserting an ultimate reality that transcends empirical description.</li>
<li><strong>Buddha</strong> disregarded all speculations as he found them useless and irrelevant to solve the practical problem of human suffering.</li>
<li><strong>Nagarjuna(150 AD)</strong> was skeptical of all philosophical standpoints. He dismantled theoretical positions in a methodically logical manner wherever he found them.</li>
<li><strong>Jayarasi Bhatta(800-840AD)</strong> author of <em>Tattvopaplava-siṁha</em>, claimed that it is not possible to arrive at true knowledge with standard means recognized by the traditionally adopted model of cognitive procedures (pramāṇa) in Indian epistemology.</li>

<li>A theory can be stable not only due to its axioms but also due to a specific intuition.</li>
<li><strong>Deduction:</strong> Logical Inference derived from self-evident propositions.</li>
<li>Descartes was convinced that philosophy when built using intuition &amp; deduction results at a system of absolute truth.</li>

<h4 id="points-of-descartes">Points of Descartes:</h4>
<h4 id="1-cartesian-methodical-doubt-">1. Cartesian Methodical Doubt-</h4>
<ul>
<li>To reach certainity, first overthrow all beliefs and doubt everything.</li>
<li>Since, you are doubting, One thing is certain that you doubt/think. This leads to <strong>Cogito, ergo sum</strong> &gt; <em><strong>I think, therefore I am(I exist)</strong></em>.</li>
<li>I intuit in a concrete case the impossibility of my thinking without my existing.</li>
<li>I am something which thinks, then what am I? A thing which thinks, then what is a thing which thinks? It is a thing which doubts, understands, affirms, denies, wills, refuses, and which also imagines and feels. Thus, <em>Cogito, ergo sum</em> was marked as the starting point of metaphysics.</li>
</ul>

<li>What causes motion and change in the universe?</li>
<li><strong>(i) Formal Cause:(Idea)</strong> The capacity of the human genes (genome) to accompany the existence of a human being presumes that the capacity to be a human being pre-exists the human being. i.e. blueprint or plan.</li>
<li><strong>(ii) Material Cause:(Matter)</strong> Matter out of which a thing is made.</li>
<li><strong>(iii) Efficient Cause:(Agency)</strong> Agency by which a thing comes into existence. {Potter - Pot}</li>

<ol start="2">
<li>I cannot be mistaken about the ideas that I have.</li>

<li>1 and 2 are certain.</li>
<li>3 rests on the <em>Principle of Sufficient Reason</em> i.e. Reality of Cause &gt;= Reality of Effect.</li>
<li>4 is Descartes' innate idea.</li>
<li>5 Substance Doctrine &gt; anything = substance/attribute of a substance. Attributes change and are subjective whereas substance remain one. Thus, Idea of substance has more formal reality than an attribute. Idea of Infinite Substance has more objective reality than idea of finite substance &amp; these are the only things that can cause an idea to emerge in my mind. Therefore, my idea of infinite substance is real.</li>
<li>6 says that the source of idea is God as more perfect cannot be derived from less perfect.</li>

<h4 id="3-theory-of-innateapriori-ideas">3. Theory of Innate(Apriori) Ideas:</h4>
<ul>
<li>By innate idea or knowledge, Descartes means that the ideas or truth impressed upon the mind = principles which the soul/mind finds itself, or the native capacity of the soul/mind to produce such knowledge without the help of the senses.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-mind-souland-body-matterproblem-cartesian-dualism">4. Mind (Soul)and Body (Matter)Problem (Cartesian Dualism):</h4>

<h4 id="1-tabula-rasaclean-slate">1. Tabula Rasa(Clean Slate)</h4>
<ul>
<li>The mind at first is a tabula rasa(dark chamber, empty cabinet, white paper) i,e. without any ideas.</li>
<li>Where the white paper gets its reason and knowledge from - <strong>Experience</strong>.</li>
<li>All our knowledge is founded on, and ultimately derived from, experience.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-camara-obscuraa-darkened-room">2. Camara Obscura(a darkened room)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Human mind is like a <em>camara obscura</em>, darkened room, into which bright pictures of what lies outside must be conveyed.</li>
<li>Observing children(<em>Pedophile LOL</em>) reveals that their capacity to think develops only gradually, as its necessary components are acquired one by one.</li>
<li>Everything that occurs to us either arrives directly through experience, or is remembered from some previous experience, or has been manufactured from the raw materials provided solely by experience. In short, Experience.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-sensation-and-reflection">3. Sensation and Reflection</h4>
<ul>
<li>The two sources of our ideas are:
<ol>
<li><strong>Sensation:</strong> external sense, through which the mind is furnished with sensible thoughts.</li>
<li><strong>Reflection:</strong> internal sense, which supplies the mind with ideas of its own operations.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-simple-ideas-and-complex-ideas">4. Simple Ideas and Complex Ideas</h4>
<ul>
<li>Acc. to Locke, Ideas =&gt; <em>whatsoever the mind directly apprehends, through perception.</em> Experience is the fountain of all ideas.</li>
<li>Sensation is the chief source of ideas.</li>
<li>The ideas received by mind are <em>simple ideas</em>, which the mind has the power to repeat, compare, and combine in endless variety, thus to make <em>new complex ideas</em>.</li>
<li>No understanding has the power to frame or invent a new simple idea.</li>
<li>Senses &gt; Colour, taste; More than 1 senses &gt; figure, rest; Reflection &gt; Its own idea observation; Both Sensation and Reflection &gt; pleasure, pain.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="5-primary-and-secondary-qualities">5. Primary and Secondary Qualities</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Primary qualities</em>, such as solidity, extension, figure, motion or rest, and number, are inherent to objects and are inseparable from them.</li>
<li><em>Secondary qualities</em>, like color, sound, and taste, exist only in our perception and are produced by the causal power of primary qualities. They are not inherent to the objects themselves but rather the effects of how our senses interact with these objects.</li>
<li>Secondary qualities are perceived by a single sense (e.g., color by sight), and they depend on the sensory apparatus responding to the dispositional properties of objects.</li>
<li>Locke argued that our belief in the existence of secondary qualities in nature is a result of the ideas produced in our minds by the primary qualities of objects.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="6-operations-of-mind">6. Operations of Mind</h4>
<ul>
<li>The mind can, by its own power, put together these simple ideas and make new complex ideas.</li>
<li>It can bring two ideas together, view them together, and thereby frame ideas of relations.</li>
<li>It can separate ideas from all other ideas which accompany them in their real existence. This operation is called abstraction.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="7-ideas-of-modes-substances-and-relations">7. Ideas of Modes, Substances and Relations</h4>
<ul>
<li>Complex ideas can be categorized under three heads:
<ol>
<li><strong>Modes:</strong> refer to complex ideas that are invariably conceived as the features of something else, which are never capable of existing independently.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>E.g. Triangle, Gratitude, Murder.</li>
<li>Two types of modes are:</li>
<li><strong>a. Simple Mode-</strong> is a complex idea all of whose component parts are variations or combinations of a single simple idea. e.g. A dozen, Space, etc.</li>
<li><strong>b. Mixed Modes-</strong> are complex ideas whose components include several distinct simple ideas, often including those derived from different experiential sources. e.g. Beauty, Human Activities.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Substances:</strong> are also complex ideas put together by mind and is a collection of simple ideas capable of existing independently.</li>
<li><strong>Relation:</strong> are complex ideas derived from the mental operation of comparing distinct ideas without thereby combining them together into an entirely new whole. e.g. parent/child or cause/effect.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="53-idealism">5.3 Idealism</h3>
<ul>
<li>Idealism is theory that upholds everything exists is mental, that is, everything is either a collection of ideas, or a mind thinking those ideas.</li>
<li>Idealists use the word “idea” to mean any kind of mental thing:
<ol>
<li>Sensations- The colours you see, the sounds you hear.</li>
<li>Concepts- The abstract idea of something.</li>
<li>Thoughts- Believes</li>
<li>Imagination and Memory</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Idealism is any theory positing the primacy of soul, mind, or language over matter.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="george-berkeley1685-1753">George Berkeley(1685-1753)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Best known for his motto, <em>esse est percipi</em>, &quot;to be is to be perceived&quot;. He was an immaterialist.</li>
<li>He believed that ordinary physical objects are composed solely of ideas, which are inherently mental.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="main-argument">Main Argument:</h4>
<ul>
<li>He attacked materialism in his <em>A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge.</em></li>
<li>Berkeley presented the following argument.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>We perceive ordinary objects.</li>
<li>We perceive only ideas.</li>
<li>Ordinary objects are ideas.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="esse-est-percipito-be-is-to-be-perceived">Esse est percipi(To be is to be perceived)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Everybody will agree that our thoughts and the pictures of imagination do not exist outside mind. Thus, existence (to be) is identical with perception.</li>
<li>Things therefore have no existence without a mind which sees or knows it.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="unperceived-objects">Unperceived objects</h4>
<ul>
<li>What about the objects which no one is looking at, listening to, thinking about?</li>
<li>When every one of us leaves this class room, does it just disappear? Then when we come next, it reappears?</li>
<li>Berkeley’s answer to that was: things we don’t perceive, or think about are kept in existence in the mind of God. =&gt; God’s mind is infinite, unlimited.</li>
<li>When we see and hear etc. something, we simply perceive a small little part of God’s mind.</li>

<h4 id="1-synthesis-of-rationalism-and-empiricism">1. Synthesis of Rationalism and Empiricism</h4>
<ul>
<li>The fundamental idea of Kant’s “critical philosophy” is <em>human autonomy</em>.</li>
<li>He argues that human understanding is the source of all the general laws of nature that in itself structures our experience.</li>
<li>Scientific knowledge, morality, and religious belief are mutually consistent and secure because they all rest on the same foundation of human autonomy.</li>
<li>He responded to Empiricists by arguing that <em>mind is not a blank slate</em> and the Rationalists by rejecting their notion that pure, a priori knowledge of a mind-independent world was possible.</li>
<li>He believed that Reason itself is structured with forms of experience and categories that in itself gives structure to empirical experience.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-transcendental-idealism">2. Transcendental idealism</h4>
<ul>
<li>In <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, Kant argued that human beings experience only appearances (phenomena), not things in themselves (noumena).</li>
<li><strong>Phenomena -</strong> a thing that appears or is perceived.</li>
<li><strong>Noumenon -</strong> imperceptible to the material senses.</li>
<li><strong>Transcendental Idelism -</strong> we must distinguish between appearances and things in themselves, that is, between that which is mind-dependent and that which is not.</li>

<h4 id="3-analytic-and-synthetic-statements">3. Analytic and Synthetic Statements</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analytic Statement:</strong> Predicate in Subject. E.g. Brothers are male. True by virtue of meaning.</li>

<h4 id="4-the-a-priori-and-a-posteriori-and-analytic-and-synthetic-distinctions">4. The a priori and a posteriori AND Analytic and Synthetic Distinctions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Apriori - We know something by just sitting and thinking.</li>
<li>Aposteriori - We know something by going out in the world and sensing things.</li>
<li><strong>Analytic a priori proposition:</strong> knowledge claims which are “self-contained.” These are the sort of judgments that you can make in and of itself without reference to anything “external.” E.g Square has 4 sides.</li>
<li><strong>Synthetic a posteriori proposition:</strong> Judgements needs to be verified. E.g. The cat is on the mat.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="5-synthetic-a-priori">5. Synthetic a priori</h4>
<ul>
<li>Essential bridge between rationalist and empiricist epistemology.</li>
<li>Claims like Newton’s, “the quantity of matter is always preserved,” and the geometer’s claim, “the angles of a triangle always add up to 180 degrees” are known a priori, but they cannot be known merely from an analysis of the concepts of matter or triangle. We must “go outside and beyond the concept. . . joining to it a priori in thought something which I have not thought in it.</li>
<li><em>A synthetic a priori claim constructs upon and adds to what is contained analytically in a concept without appealing to experience.</em></li>
<li>Ex: “5+7 = 12” because 12 is not contained in 5+7.</li>

<h4 id="1-practical-reason-and-ought--duty">1. Practical Reason and “Ought” + Duty</h4>
<ul>
<li>Kant is <strong>deontologist</strong> which means he believed in a sense of “duty” which one should follow on all occasions.</li>
<li>He split reason into two categories - <strong>a. Theoretical/Pure Reason</strong> (covering Maths and Science) and <strong>b. Practical Reason</strong>*(Superior as it led to people becoming morl/good people)*</li>
<li>Practical reason is also grounded in a sense of “ought”. In other words, people can become aware of duty in each case by careful consideraation and weighing of the facts.</li>
<li><strong>Ought implies can</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-categorical-imperative-and-hypothetical-imperative">2. Categorical Imperative and Hypothetical Imperative</h4>
<ul>
<li>Introduced in Kant's book <em>Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals.</em>\</li>
<li>Kant thought that human beings occupy a <em>special place in universe</em> and that <em>morality</em> can be summed up in one, <em>ultimate commandment</em> of reason, or imperative, from which all duties and obligations derive.</li>
<li>A hypothetical imperative would compel action in a given circumstance: <em>If I wish to satisfy my thirst, then I must drink something.</em></li>
<li>A categorical imperative would denote an <strong>absolute, unconditional requirement</strong> that exerts its authority in all circumstances, both required and justified as an end in itself.</li>
<li>Ex. H - If you obey God then you will get to heaven. C - Obey God! It is your duty.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-merit-of-categorical-imperative">3. Merit of Categorical Imperative</h4>
<ul>
<li>Moral actions cannot be stated as hypothetical imperative as it then depends on the subjective desires of the actor rendering it powerless.</li>
